# americas-water
America's Water Integrated Model, using the Julia IAMF framework.

# Basic Setup

1. Install Julia and Juno (a Julia editor) with the most recent bundle: http://junolab.org/docs/install.html
2. Clone this Git repository: `git clone  https://github.com/AmericasWater/americas-water.git`
3. Open Julia (in Juno or from the command line) and type `Pkg.clone("https://github.com/davidanthoff/IAMF.jl.git")` to install IAMF.
4. Open up main.jl in Juno and run it.  It will take a minute as Julia compiles the code.
5. Click on the final result (in a box "linearVariables"), and you should see a list of numbers starting with 1, 0, -1, -2.
